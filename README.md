## Installation

You can install the released version of sessionDiffo from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("sessionDiffo")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("federicomarini/sessionDiffo")
```

## Why?

Ever encountered a situation where the configuration of two systems is
different?

Examples:

  - a newer package introduced changes in the functionality, and you
    have different setups on different machines. You might want to
    pinpoint what is different

  - debugging/reporting an issue: you encounter a bug, or someone
    reports it to you, and you want to compare the full set of packages
    that are available in the two different setups

<!-- end list -->

``` r
library(sessionDiffo)
# start the ShinySessionDiffo app
ssd()
```

## Development

If you encounter a bug, have usage questions, or want to share ideas and
functionality to make this package better, feel free to file an
[issue](https://github.com/federicomarini/sessionDiffo/issues).
